# acey-deucey
A game where two cards are drawn and you have to guess whether a third card will be in between the first two or not. 

Updates: 
* 4/11/17 - Not very pretty, but it works! 
* 4/10/17 - This is a work in progress, and as such, does not actually function yet. 
 
Planned Changes: 
* Let the user click the first button to clear the old cards and restart the game, rather than having to reload the page. 
* When an ace is drawn as the first or second card, let the user decide if it is high or low. 
* Win/Loss counter.
* Use something other than prompt box to get the user's guess?
